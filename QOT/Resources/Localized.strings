Ideally, your perceived recovery should be equal to or greater than your perceived load. This would mean you created a performance buffer and you are ready for the challenges ahead. If your perceived recovery score is less than your perceived load, you should increase the amount of your sleep, improve the quality of your sleep, and improve your overall recovery plan.

It also helps you become more purposeful in the way you design your schedule and prepare for your meetings. We have found that more than 6 meetings a day makes it very difficult to prepare properly and to have adequate thinking, problem solving, and working time. On days when your meeting load is high you may want to consider activating your Tough Day plan.";

We recommend taking an average of 15 minutes between your meetings to plan for oscillation, preparation, and reflection. These three key strategies are critical to helping you Rule Your QOT. When planning your day, try reviewing your meetings to see if you can fit in a few more 15-minute breaks. The closer your average is to 15 minutes, the closer your graph will be to becoming a complete circle. If your average time between meetings is 15 minutes or greater, you will receive a score of 10 and have a completed circle.";
